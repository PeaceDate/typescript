// Void. Void is a little like the opposite of any: the absence of having any type at all.

// Diferece between void and undefined. undefined is a type, void is not. undefined is a value, void is not.

// Example

function log(message: string): void {
  console.log(message);
}

// void meens that we ignore the return value of the function
